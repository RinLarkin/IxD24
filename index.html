    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to my interaction design project, which focuses on the gamifaction of learning apps; with the aim of making the learning experience more engaging and interactive for our userbase, therefore improving their learning outcomes.
    <br><br>
    Gamification: the application of game design principles to non-game contexts; in this case education, to increase motivation, engagment and enjoyment.
    <br><br>
    Within this project is several phases, including a competitive analysis, wireframing, prototyping and usability testing:
    <br><br>
    Competitive Analysis will help to identify the strengths and weaknesses in the existing market, and highlighting areas to improve on.
    <br><br>
    Wireframing & Prototyping allows us to design and develop the interface and user experience of the app, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable learning process.
    <br><br>
    Usability Testing allows us to gather feedback from users on the app's usability and functionally by having them test the app. Using this feedback, we will refine and improve the app, ensuring that the user's needs are met.</p>
