                        CodeCombat tracks progress using a level up system (using gems that users collect throughout the levels, to level up), as well as tracking each level the user has made it through and the various dungeons in which they’ve completed.

                        Typing.com tracks a range of stats, from how far users are into a lesson, to their average typing speed, accuracy, and achievements they’ve made while using the website; while also tracking a daily goal that users can set for how long they want to practice typing every day. However, all these stats can only be logged if the user makes an account with them.

                        Kahoot uses a minimalistic and modern design, in combination with colourful assets to make the quizzes visually appealing to their userbase. However, their actual website is a bit of a mess to look at.
                    <br><br>
                        However, their services are locked behind making an account, as well as a paywall if users wish to access more content. While it’s important for Kahoot to make revenue to continue making their website, it should have a few free quizzes for new users to try out, before signing up/paying to access the service.

                        Personally, the tutorial and character interface is a little overwhelming and difficult to interpretate, but this issue might vary from user to user.

                        While there’s free access to play CodeCombat, if users wish to track progress an account must be made. Also to unlock more coding languages and dungeons, users must make payments to do so.

                        Typing.com’s interface is minimalistic and modern, also using a minimal colour palette and graphics to decorate the website and make it more visually appealing, as well as navigate. Although, users have access to themes, to change the appearance of the website also.
                        <br><br>
                        Typing.com also has prompts, and visual graphics to aid users in understanding how to use the website, as well as simplistic explanations that get straight to the point, and don’t use excessive jargon or detailed explanations that will only confuse users.
